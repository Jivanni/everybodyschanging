# Word2Vec Explorer

This tool helps you visualize, query and explore Word2Vec models. Word2Vec is a deep learning technique that feeds massive amounts of text into a shallow neural net which can then be used to solve a variety of NLP and ML problems.

Word2Vec Explorer uses [Gensim](https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim) to list and compare vectors and it uses [t-SNE](https://github.com/danielfrg/tsne) to visualize a dimensional reduction of the vector space. [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is used for K-Means clustering.

The UI is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/), [D3](http://d3js.org) and [Three.js](http://threejs.org).

### Setup

To install all Python depenencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Load the explorer with a Word2Vec model:

```bash
./explore GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
```

Now point your browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to load the explorer!

### Obtaining Pre-Trained Models

A classic example of Word2Vec is the Google News model trained on 600M sentences: [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing)

### Development

In order to make changes to the user interface you will need some NPM dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The command `npm start` will automatically transpile and bundle any code changes in the `ui/` folder. All backend code can be found in `explorer.py` and `./explore`.

Before submitting code changes make sure all code is compliant with StandardJS as well as Pep8:

```bash
standard
pep8 --max-line-length=100 *.py explore
```

### Todo

- 3D GPU/WebGL view (on branch `3d`)
- Make sure axes stay when zooming/panning scatterplot
- Autocomplete in query interface
- Look into supporting other high dimensional data models (go beyond word vectors)
- Drill-down of vector that shows real distance between neighbors
- Improved sample rated view that takes into account term counts and connectedness
